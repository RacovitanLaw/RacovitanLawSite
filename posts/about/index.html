            <p>Andra Racovitan is the founder and CEO of Racovitan Law PPLC. She was born and raised in Romania. She is fluent in English, Romanian, and Spanish.
As an immigrant who was born and raised in a different country, she understands bothâ€”the privilege to be in the United States and yet the difficulty of navigating through the immigration system.
Her Romanian upbringing coupled with her bond with other immigrants when she arrived in the United States made her curious and fondly appreciative of the topic of immigration.
Her curiosity transformed into a deep-rooted desire to serve the people in this great country who, like her, have a unique story and an American dream! For this reason she chose to go to law school and pursue immigration law.
Her goal is to create a safe space for those who feel vulnerable through this very difficult immigration process.
In her free time, Andra enjoys cooking, working out, traveling, spending time with her husband and their cat Mace, and Dallas events with friends!</p>
