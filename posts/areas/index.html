<h3 id="family-immigration">Family Immigration</h3>
<p>Certain family members in the United States may petition for close relatives and sponsor those relatives abroad for a green card. A green card provides an opportunity to stay in the United States permanently. Some foreign relatives may need unlawful presence waivers, or forgiveness pardons for their unlawful presence or unlawful entry. Others may parole in place “PIP” through a child who serves in the US Armed forces.</p>
<br />
<p>To summarize, some family based immigration benefits are:</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li>CITIZENSHIP</li>
<li>ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS</li>
<li>PAROLE IN PLACE</li>
<li>UNLAWFUL PRESENCE WAIVERS</li>

Regardless of its name, this act applies to, and protects  both: men and women. If you are the victim of emotional, physical, or mental abuse at the hands of your LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENT or US Citizen Spouse or Parent, you may seek relief and qualify for a green card under this law. If you have been abused by your US CITIZEN child, you may qualify for this type of relief.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>U-VISA</strong>: If you were the victim of a qualifying crime in the United States, were cooperative with law enforcement regarding the crime, and are willing to cooperate with law enforcement regarding the crime, you may qualify for U-VISA relief.</p>
<br />
