## Immigration Law

<br />

### Family Immigration

Certain family members in the United States may petition for close relatives and sponsor those relatives abroad for a green card. A green card provides an opportunity to stay in the United States permanently. Some foreign relatives may need unlawful presence waivers, or forgiveness pardons for their unlawful presence or unlawful entry. Others may parole in place “PIP” through a child who serves in the US Armed forces.

<br />

To summarize, some family based immigration benefits are:

<br />

- CITIZENSHIP
- ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS
